My name is Laura and I am a software engineer. \
Currently, I am studying data science at the FH Joanneum Graz. While working on my master's thesis, I am trying to build a prototype for in-cabin gaze estimation in the autonomous driving area using Flutter as cross-platform mobile application framework and transformers as detection model. \
By working part-time at Virtual Vehicle, I am trying to get more experience in this field.
