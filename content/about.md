My name is Laura and I am a software engineer. \
Currently, I am studying data science at the FH Joanneum Graz. In my master thesis I am trying to build an prototype of in-cabin gaze estimation using Flutter and transformers. By working part-time at Virtual Vehicle, I am trying to get more experience in this field.
